                <h2>About Me & This Site</h2> <br>
                <em> This site being my memory wasteland is some sort of a life log or a rebellion to real world state. 
                    Perhaps also a farewell to my past. Since as a person with probably bipolar disorder, 
                    despite my impulse to build this site long time ago, 
                    recently I was hunted by memories of my past and it drags into a infinite nihilism and strong sense of nostalgia.
                    So it came to me that it is always necessary to write down whatever pain and happiness:
                    When I turned back and recall my life 10 years ago as a child or a teenager, 
                    it just gives me a feeling of so unreal and cannot imagine how a person can change over time.
                    Indeed me 10 years ago and 10 years later are two absolute different person, but luckily some character have never changed.
                    I shall be strong enough and endure the waves of memories, both good and bad, that shape who I am today. 
                    This site will be my sanctuary, a place where I can pour out my thoughts and emotions without fear of judgment
                </em>

                <h2>Film Reviews</h2> <br>
                <em>Here are my thoughts on films that I have watched since 2017? <br>
                   By the time I was enthusiastic and most of the time alone. <br>
                   I got the time to watch and share my thoughts on all of them. <br>
                   Things changed a lot over the years; I slowed and stalled my process of each film. <br>
                   However, I still have that interest. If you share the same interest, you can click the button below.
